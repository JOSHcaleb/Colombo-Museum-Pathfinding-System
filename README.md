# Colombo-Museum-Pathfinding-System

### Project Summary
A classic Computer Science project focused on algorithmic graph traversal and route optimization. This system models the National Museum of Colombo's floor plan as a weighted graph, enabling efficient pathfinding between any two exhibits or rooms.

The core objective was to implement and compare different search algorithms to find the most optimal routes for visitors, demonstrating proficiency in data structure modeling and core algorithmic problem-solving.

### Key Features and Technical Details
- Problem Modeling: The complex, multi-room layout of the museum (including two floors) was meticulously mapped and defined as a weighted graph where nodes represent exhibits/rooms and weighted edges represent the distance (cost) of travel between them.

- Core Algorithms Implemented:

Breadth-First Search (BFS): Implemented to find the shortest path in terms of the number of stops/edges.

Depth-First Search (DFS): Implemented for exploring all possible paths, demonstrating a fundamental understanding of recursive search strategies.

A* Search (A-Star): (Implied by the code structure) Implemented as an informed search algorithm to find the overall shortest path in terms of total distance/cost, utilizing a heuristic function for optimal efficiency.

- Technology Stack:

Language: Prolog (.pl): Utilized this declarative programming language to define the knowledge base (rooms and edges) and implement the complex recursive logic for the search algorithms, showcasing specialized programming skills.

- Functionality: The system can query the knowledge base to:

Find all possible paths between a start and goal location.

Identify the shortest path (in terms of cost) using the A* Search and cost functions.

Demonstrate the path generated by non-optimal but fundamental algorithms (BFS and DFS).
